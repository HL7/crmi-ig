The knowledge is typically expressed independent of delivery method (modality), technology platform, and implementation site. Knowledge at this level is typically authored by knowledge engineers to enable precise communication and validation of the recommendations."

The knowledge is typically expressed focusing on a specific delivery method (modality), technology platform, and implementation environment. Knowledge at this level is typically built and developed by implementers working in specific technology platforms, for the purpose of implementation at a specific site, though affordances such as computable mappings and configuration capabilities can broaden the usability of the knowledge artifact."
