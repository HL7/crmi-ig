{: #distribution}

Distribution involves the APIs for searching and retrieving published artifacts. There are a few APIs this IG supports, including:

* [FHIR Package / NPM](#distribution-fhir-package)
* [FHIR REST API](#distribution-fhir-rest)
* [$package and $data-requirements](#package-and-data-requirements)
* [Manifest support](#distribution-manifest) for canonical version specification
* [Syndication (Atom RSS)](#distribution-syndication)

### FHIR Packages / NPM
{: #distribution-fhir-package}

Like publishing, [FHIR Packages](https://hl7.org/fhir/packages.html) are a way to distribute content. This is compatible with IG Publisher, SUSHI and the NPM client.

```
npm --registry=http://fhir-package-registry install @scope/fhir.uv.test.my-package
```

This example illustrates the use of an NPM package registry to install IG packages as NPM packages. This example also illustrates the use of NPM Scopes for FHIR packages.

See also [Publishing and Downloading FHIR (NPM) Packages](publishing-fhir-package.html) for implementation details.

### FHIR REST API
{: #distribution-fhir-rest}

Read and search operations can be used to distribute artifacts, see [Artifact Repository](artifact-repository-service.html) and [Artifact Terminology Service](artifact-terminology-service.html) capability statements. FHIR read and search **SHOULD** be available for all canonical resources.

### $package and $data-requirements
{: #package-and-data-requirements}

Downstream systems **MAY** require all content dependencies. These dependencies can cross IG/package boundaries, as intended for reusability (e.g. a common Library could be used by two Measures, or an ActivityDefinition could be used by several PlanDefinitions in different content IGs). Furthermore, some content might have been published outside a content IG/FHIR Package.

<div style="max-width:800px;">
{% include img.html img="CRMI-PackageOperation.png" %}
</div>

To facilitate this, a downstream system MAY use the `$package` or `$data-requirements` operation(s) on a canonical resource to resolve dependencies.

* [$package](OperationDefinition-crmi-package.html): The Artifact Repository assembles a FHIR Bundle of the target resource, and all of its dependencies for a client.
* [$data-requirements](OperationDefinition-crmi-data-requirements.html): The Artifact Repository assembles a FHIR Library with all the dependencies listed. The client can then download as needed.

NOTE: $data-requirements allows the client to decide what is needed to download (versus what might already have been downloaded), whereas $package always ships the actual resources.

Both `$package` and `$data-requirements` operations are available for all canonical resources:

1. StructureDefinition, StructureMap
2. ValueSet, CodeSystem, NamingSystem, ConceptMap
3. Questionnaire, ActivityDefinition, PlanDefinition, Library, Measure
4. ObservationDefinition, SpecimenDefinition, MedicationKnowledge, etc...

NOTE: To recreate the contents of a FHIR Package, the `$package` operation could be called on the `ImplementationGuide` resource with appropriate parameters to only include local resources defined in the package (i.e. `packageOnly` set to `true`).

### $license-requirements

It is common for knowledge artifacts to depend on other artifacts, which in turn depend on other artifacts. There may be different copyright owners along this dependency tree of artifacts. To ensure license compliance, we need a way to inventory the license information for an artifact and all of it's dependencies.

#### License Extension

All knowledge artifacts (excluding ImplementationGuide, since there is already a `.license` element, a new extension to be defined) may have a [license extension](StructureDefinition-crmi-license.html) to document the license for the artifact e.g.:

```jsonc
{
  "meta": {
    "extension": [
      {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/artifact-license",
        "valueCode": "not-open-source"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

All knowledge artifacts may have a [license-detail extension](StructureDefinition-crmi-license-detail.html) to document the license detail for an artifact, especially useful when the licens is `not-open-source` e.g.:

```jsonc
{
  "meta": {
    "extension": [
      {
        "url": "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/artifact-license-detail",
        "valueMarkdown": "# ACME Restricted License\n\ndetails here"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

NOTE: During package publishing, a CRMI Artifact Repository may add these extensions to all knowledge artifacts if not already present based on information from the package's ImplementationGuide.


#### Operation $license-requirements 

Operation [$license-requirements](OperationDefinition-crmi-license-requirements.html) that returns a Parameters resource listing for each resource out:

* canonical (reference to the artifact)
* publisher
* copyright
* license and license detail (as specified using extensions above)

**NOTE: Similar to $package and $data-requirements, this will trace all dependencies, see below.**

Request:

```
GET /Measure/$license-requirements
    ?url=http://acme.org/Measure/my-measure
    &version=1.2.0
```

Response:

```jsonc
{
  "resourceType": "Parameters",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "http://acme.org/Measure/my-measure",
      "parameter": [
        {

        },
        {
          "name": "publisher",
          "valueString": "Acme Inc"
        },
        {
          "name": "copyright",
          "valueMarkdown": "Copyright notice"
        },
        {
          "name": "canonical",
          "valueCanonical": "http://acme.org/Library/my-lib|1.2.0"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Dependency Tracing

Dependency tracing is the process of determining, given a root artifact, what other artifacts are referenced by the artifact, recursively, to produce a complete listing of all the artifacts (or _dependencies_) required for the artifact to be used. Because FHIR artifacts in general have many different ways of referencing other artifacts, the process needs to be described per resource type. In addition, because new extensions can be introduced and used at any point, the process needs to support a mechanism for allowing new content to indicate whether it constitutes a dependency for this purpose.

In general, the process considers each element of a resource and, if it is a canonical reference, or a reference to an "artifact" resource as described by this implementation guide, it is traced. In addition, extensions used in quality improvement profiles such as Clinical Guidelines and Quality Measures, are considered.

The following sections describe the dependency references for each type of resource. Note that this dependency-listing is not exhaustive, but captures the required dependencies for the quality improvement use case. The [cqf-shouldTraceDependency]({{site.data.fhir.ver.ext}}/StructureDefinition-cqf-shouldTraceDependency.html) extension can be used in the definition of an extension or profile to indicate whether the element should be traced as a dependency for the purposes of packaging and distribution.

Each section provides a listing of the paths to each element that should be considered as a reference to an artifact (and recursively traced for dependencies as well) using a FHIRPath-like syntax, with abbreviated references to the names of extensions to be followed.

Note that the following extensions may be safely ignored for the purposes of dependency tracing:

```
StructureDefinition http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-type-must-support
StructureDefinition http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-type-must-support
StructureDefinition http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/codesystem-properties-mode
```

### Manifest
{: #distribution-manifest}

Canonical references **MAY** be authored without a version. To ensure consistent versions of resources are used by downstream systems, a manifest parameter to specify canonical versions **MAY** be passed to FHIR operations that use dynamic requirements: `$package` and `$data-requirements`; in addition to execution operations that can use a content endpoint to resolve canonical resources such as `$apply` from CPG and `$evaluate-measure` from DEQM IG.

More information on [manifest specification](version-manifest.html)

### Syndication
{: #distribution-syndication}

Syndication allows broadcasting of content changes to interested parties. The syndication mechanism proposed in the IG **MAY** be used by downstream systems, or federated Artifact Repositories so preemptive downloading, or notification message send to interested parties.

The syndication API **SHALL** be based on ATOM, an example is shown below:

### Uplinks / Mirrors
{: #distribution-uplinks}

Uplinks or mirrors are common in software artifact registries. Many times organizations have a virtualized registry that can route installation requests either locally (for local, private packages) or remotely to configured uplinks as show below:

<div style="max-width:800px;">
{% include img.html img="CRMI-Uplinks.png" %}
</div>

This can simplify tooling for distribution to downstream systems, and can decrease brittleness relying on upstream systems to be available.

### Downstream System(s)
{: #downstream-systems}

Systems using sharable content, including: authoring systems, clinical data repositories, quality measure engines, decision support engines, care management systems, and assessment filler applications.

### Distribution client capabilities
{: #distribution-client-capabilities}

Distribution clients must be able to consume the artifacts produced by upstream systems, either as IG packages, or as artifact bundles, depending on how the upstream systems choose to distribute artifact content.

For IG packages, the FHIR publishing ecosystem, including the FHIR validation tooling, already provide implementation support for integrating with the FHIR registry to download packaged implementation guide content as published for FHIR implementation guides. Applications can either make use of this existing tooling, or build tooling appropriate for their platform to integrate with the FHIR registry feed (or other upstream feeds as described above).

Note that for artifact bundles that are the result of the $package operation, bundles may be requested that include duplicate artifacts. Client applications that consume artifact bundles must be prepared for this case.

In addition, client applications must ensure that artifact references are resolved correctly. If an artifact reference is unversioned, a version manifest for the artifact should be consulted to determine the appropriate version-binding information. See the Artifact Scope discussion for information on how to identify the version manifest appropriate for a particular artifact.
