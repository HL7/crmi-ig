For example, the versions of code systems used in value sets referenced by the artifacts must be identified so that terminology servers performing expansions can unambiguously select the version of each code system used to perform the expansion.",

Artifact manifests are used throughout the content development lifecycle to establish version bindings for unversioned canonical references. Prior to release (when the status is draft) of the artifact(s), the manifest establishes the expansion rules such as code system versions used for expansion of value sets while artifacts are being authored. As part of release, the manifest is used to provide a complete dependency listing, as well as complete binding for all unversioned dependencies referenced in the artifacts so that canonical references can be reliably resolved, ensuring the stability of value set expansions used for evaluation of the artifacts.",

Post release, the artifact(s) may specify expansion identifiers to lock the code lists used for value sets. Provisional codes can be specified using the code system version mechanism (i.e. it is not the case that only one code system version can be specified per code system in an expand, and a manifest).",
