Data requirements SHALL be at least the de-duplicated set of all data requirements for the primary library and all referenced libraries, recursively, and SHOULD be the set of data requirements reachable by expressions referenced from the artifact, and SHOULD use the mustSupport element of data requirements to indicate which elements of a data element are actually referenced by the artifact logic.",
