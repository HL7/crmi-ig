# This IG YML file is inspired by the ImplementationGuide resource
# and also draws from package.json, package-list.json, and ig.ini.
# That said, it is structured for ease-of-use, so it is not strictly
# conformant to any of those existing configuration formats.

# SUSHI will use id as both id and packageId in the IG unless a
# specific packageId is also provided in this file.

title: Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure Implementation Guide
description: >-
  This implementation guide defines profiles, operations, capability statements
  and guidance to facilitate the content management lifecycle for authoring,
  publishing, distribution, and implementation of FHIR knowledge artifacts such
  as value sets, profiles, libraries, rules, and measures. The guide is
  intended to be used by specification and content implementation guide authors
  as both a dependency for validation of published artifacts, and a guide for
  construction and publication of content.

# supports 4.0.1 anyway).
fhirVersion: 4.0.1

# The following two lines correspond to items that used to be in
# ig.ini but were moved to IG.definition.parameter. For
# consistency within this file, the names are represented using
# camelcase, but if authors use the formal parameter names, SUSHI
# will recognize them as well. In either case, they'll be copied
# to the IG JSON using the formal names.

# The resources property corresponds to IG.definition.resource.
# SUSHI can auto-generate all of the resource entries based on
# the FSH definitions and/or information in any user-provided
# JSON or XML resource files. If the generated entries are not
# sufficient or complete, however, the author can add entries
# here. If the reference matches a generated entry, it will
# replace the generated entry. If it doesn't match any generated
# entries, it will be added to the generated entries. The format
# follows IG.definition.resource with the following differences:
#   * use IG.definition.resource.reference.reference as the YAML key.
#   * if the key is an id or name, SUSHI will replace it with the
#     correct URL when generating the IG JSON.
#   * specify "omit" to omit a FSH-generated resource from the
#     resource list.
#   * if the exampleCanonical is an id or name, SUSHI will replace
#     it with the correct canonical when generating the IG JSON.
#   * groupingId can be used, but top-level groups syntax may be a
#     better option (see below).
# The following are simple examples to demonstrate what this might
# look like:
#
# resources:
  # ImplementationGuide/hl7.fhir.uv.cpg.chf: omit #omit this because this template does not generate HTML for IG, so the link from TOC fails
