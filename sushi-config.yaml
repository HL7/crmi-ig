# This IG YML file is inspired by the ImplementationGuide resource
# and also draws from package.json, package-list.json, and ig.ini.
# That said, it is structured for ease-of-use, so it is not strictly
# conformant to any of those existing configuration formats.

# SUSHI will use id as both id and packageId in the IG unless a
# specific packageId is also provided in this file.

title: Canonical Resource Management Infrastructure Implementation Guide
description: >-
  This implementation guide defines profiles, operations, capability statements
  and guidance to facilitate the content management lifecycle for authoring,
  publishing, distribution, and implementation of FHIR knowledge artifacts such
  as value sets, profiles, libraries, rules, and measures. The guide is
  intended to be used by specification and content implementation guide authors
  as both a dependency for validation of published artifacts, and a guide for
  construction and publication of content.

# Although fhirVersions is 0..* in the ImplementationGuide resource
# it can be a single item OR and array here (but so far SUSHI only
# supports 4.0.1 anyway).
fhirVersion: 4.0.1

# The following two lines correspond to items that used to be in
# ig.ini but were moved to IG.definition.parameter. For
# consistency within this file, the names are represented using
# camelcase, but if authors use the formal parameter names, SUSHI
# will recognize them as well. In either case, they'll be copied
# to the IG JSON using the formal names.

# The publisher can be a single item or a list, each with a name and
# optional url and/or email. The first publisher's name will be used
# as IG.publisher.  The contact details and/or additional publishers
# will be translated into IG.contact values.

# The dependencies property corresponds to IG.dependsOn. The key is the
# package id and the value is the version (or dev/current). For advanced
# use cases, the value can be an object with keys for `uri` and `version`.
# For R5 ImplementationGuides, the object can also have a key for `reason`.
